# Top 10 Movies
This is a project where I'm practicing html, css &amp; javaScript basics.
- The main branch is a legacy first draft with no CSS.
- The multiplePages branch is a branch where I added another site called Top 5 Books that is linked to the Top 10 Movies page. This branch also has a dedicated style.css stylesheet where I learned CSS basics and implemented media queries.
